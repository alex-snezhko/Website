    My name's Alex Snezhko, and I'm a junior majoring in Computer Science at
    <a href="https://ncsu.edu">North Carolina State University</a>. I have had a deep passion
    for all things programming ever since I took my first programming class in high
    school over 4 years ago.

<p>
    Throughout my curriculum thusfare at State, I have learned a lot about programming/computer science
    fundamentals, including the following:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Software Development
        <ul>
            <li>Test-driven development</li>
            <li>Design patterns, such as Model-View-Controller</li>
            <li>Software development life cycle</li>
            <li>Software design methodologies, including agile frameworks such as Scrum</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Data Structures/Algorithms
        <ul>
            <li>Linear, branching, and hashing data structures</li>
            <li>Algorithm complexity analysis</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Low-level programming
        <ul>
            <li>Memory management</li>
            <li>C and x86 assembler programming</li>
            <li>Computer organization</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Operating Systems
        <ul>
            <li>Linux system API and implementation</li>
            <li>Task scheduling/multitasking</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>

    Learning new programming concepts or working on personal software projects has been
    a hobby of mine for some time now. I have uploaded most of my completed projects to
    my <a href="https://github.com/alexsnezhko3">Github</a> page, and have brief descriptions
    of all of those projects <a href="projects.html">here</a>.
