            Hi, I'm Alex! I'm a software engineer with a love for learning, solving problems, and building useful software.
          </p>
          <p>
            Aside from a career path, I consider programming and technology more broadly as hobbies of mine. I love learning new tech, building software projects for fun, and tinkering with Linux distributions and other software (my current weapons of choice are <a className="fedora-link" href="https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/project/">Fedora Linux</a> and <a className="neovim-link" href="https://neovim.io/">Neovim</a>).
          </p>
          <p>
            I take pride in the code I write, and am always looking for new opportunities to improve my craft.
