            Hi, I'm Alex! I'm a software engineer with a love for learning, solving problems, and building useful software.
          </p>
          <p>
            Aside from a career path, I consider programming and technology as hobbies of mine; I love learning new tech stacks, building my own hobby software projects, and tinkering with Linux distributions and other open-source software (my current weapons of choice are <a className="fedora-link" href="https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/project/">Fedora Linux</a> and <a className="neovim-link" href="https://neovim.io/">Neovim</a>).
          </p>
          <p>
            I take pride in the software I write, and am a huge proponent of writing elegant, readable, and maintainable code. I am always looking for the next opportunity to refactor or optimize the code I write, and I believe this mindset has gotten me where I am today.
